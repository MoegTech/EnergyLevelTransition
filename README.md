## Setup Dev Environment

If you are using Windows, MacOSX, Linux, FreeBSD etc.:

```./gradlew <task>```

- Get Necessary Files

    - Firstly, clone ELT Project by executing this under your project directory:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/MoegTech/EnergyLevelTransition.git
        ```

- Setup Gradle

    - Then, Use IntelliJ or Eclipse to open `build.gradle` file in the project directory, and choose `Import as project`

    - Wait for Gradle to sync

    - Run `gradlew genIntellijRuns` or `gradlew genEclipseRuns` under project directory to generate necessary files

- Setup Mappings

    - We use a mapping based on Mojang's Official Mappings with parameter names from MCP and Yarn. 
      The [Script](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/Mappificator) to create the mappings is made by [AlcatrazEscapee](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee)

    - You must install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). (Python will invoke mvn via command line so it must be on your path.)
        - To check if Maven is functional, run mvn --version in a console window    

    - To generate the mappings, you need to run `/src/mappificator.py` for only once

- Running and Building
  
    - Run `gradlew build` under root directory to build artifacts in `build/libs`

    - Run `gradlew runClient` to run Minecraft Client with the Mod.

For more setup instructions or questions encountered please check the [Forge Docs](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.x/gettingstarted/) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
