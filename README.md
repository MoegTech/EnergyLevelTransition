## Introduction

A Tech Mod that brings in Science, Etherology, and Magic!

## Acknowledgement

## Dependencies

- Cardinal Components API
- Lib GUI
- Lib Block Attributes

Users don't need to download them separately since they are nested in this mod. 

## Setup Dev Environment

If you are using Windows, use the following style

```gradlew <task>```

or if you're using MacOSX/Linux/Unix:

```./gradlew <task>```

1. Firstly, clone ELT Project by executing `git clone https://github.com/MoegTech/EnergyLevelTransition.git` under your root directory. 

2. Rename your working directory into `ELT_Workspace` (not arbitrary), we call it the root directory. 

3. Then, Use IntelliJ or Eclipse to open `build.gradle` file in the root directory, and choose`import as project`. (Eclipse users might need to run `gradlew eclipse` after importing it)

4. Once Gradle is synced, you succeed partially!

5. Run `gradlew genSources` under root directory to generate Minecraft sources for reference. 

6. Run `gradlew build` under root directory to build artifacts in both `./ELT_Workspace/build/libs`, `./ELT_Workspace/elt/build/libs`, and `./ELT_Workspace/eltcore/build/libs`.

7. Run `gradlew :elt:runClient` to run Minecraft Client with entire ELT.

For more setup instructions or questions encountered please check the [fabric setup tutorial](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## Updating Minecraft

When we update the environment for a newer MC version, we need to follow the steps below.

Firstly, change the version variables in `gradle.properties`. For example:

```
# Fabric Properties: see updates here: https://modmuss50.me/fabric.html
 minecraft_version=1.16.4
 yarn_mappings=1.16.4+build.6
 loader_version=0.10.6+build.214
 fabric_version=0.25.1+build.416-1.16
```

Secondly, run `gradlew :elt:migrateMappings <yarn_mappings>` and `gradlew :eltcore:migrateMappings <yarn_mappings>` 
You will get `remappedSrc` directory under `:elt` and `:eltcore`. Use the `remappedSrc/com` to replace the existing `src/main/java/com` directory in both `:elt` and `:eltcore`

Thirdly, run `gradlew build` and `gradlew :elt:runClient` normally to see if it works well. 

If you encounter problems, try
Run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh dependencies or
run `gradlew cleanLoom` to clean Loom cache. Delete the `{%USER-HOME%}/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom` folder if the you really screwed up.
